# 🎮 Bakırçay Fall-2024 Game Development Project Overview

This is a 3D matching game I developed as part of my coursework at Bakırçay University during the Fall 2024 semester. My goal with this project is to improve my basic game development skills using Unity and to gain hands-on experience with 3D object interactions.

## 🛠️ Midterm Progress

By the midterm deadline, I managed to complete the core mechanics of my game, which include:

### 1. 🔧 Basic Game Setup
- I created a game area with randomly placed 3D objects.
- I designed a placement zone at the bottom of the screen for players to drop the objects into. This zone ensures that objects are placed correctly.

### 2. 🎯 Object Interaction
- I implemented a system that allows players to select and drag objects.
- To maintain order, I made sure only one object could be placed in the placement zone at a time.

### 3. ✨ Bonus Feature
- To make the game visually appealing, I added subtle lighting effects to the placement zone.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Players can select any 3D object randomly placed in the game area.  
- Objects can be dragged using a mouse or a touchscreen.  
- Objects can then be dropped into the designated placement zone.  
- If a second object is added to the placement zone, the first one will be thrown out to ensure only one object remains in the zone.  

## 📝 Notes

- **🛠️ Unity Version:** Unity 2022.3.31f

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Final Phase)

For the final phase, I plan to:
1. 🧩 Add matching object pairs to the game.
2. 🏆 Implement a scoring system and logic for object matching.
3. 🎨 Improve visuals and overall user experience.
